        <h1>5 Years From Now</h1>
      <p>
        5 Years from now, knowing what I want to be is very hard to think
        of because I am still very indecisive on what I want to be. But by
        taking this course I had the glimpse of what is in the IT 
        industry. I know that it won't be easy and there will be more
        hardships to come. All I can say is that 5 years from now, I will
        be using all of the lessons that I've learned in this course.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite all of the sleepless nights and all the hardships that 
        we've been through and will go through, I know for a reason that 
        it will all of this will be worth it. I believe that the lessons 
        being taught to us was all from the experience of our Professor 
        that had also been a student of PUP-Taguig and that he knows how 
        it's like to work in this industry. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a student who is thriving to reach my goals and to be
        successful in life. 5 Years from now I will be working in a great
        company, and I will be building a great career in the IT industry.
        I will be the one providing help to my parents and my sibling.
        All of the sacrifices that my parents made for me will all be
        repaid and I will make sure to give them a good life.
