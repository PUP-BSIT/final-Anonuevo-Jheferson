      <h2>Mode of Class</h2>
      <p>Face to Face Classes or Online Classes?</p>
      <p>
        My Opinion on the mode of classes is very dependent to the way it will
        affect the class on a certain subject. For example, if the weather is
        too harsh to bear, it might be best to have an online class
        considering the safety and the ones who are very far from the school.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is very important for me to attend Face to Face Classes due to the
        fact that a school is a place to study. It eliminates the external
        factors like being distracted by the given tasks of parents, the
        unnecessary use of phones, and being asleep while having an online
        class. That's why I really do enjoy having Face to face classes during
        this subject, I am really focused and the discipline to learn and
        execute the lessons. Yes it is hard for me to be able to absorb and
        apply the lessons since the topic is new, but the way it is being
        taught to us is very elegant since all the necessary steps are already
        provided in the ppt and the hands on teachings that we are seeing is
        very helpful and wishes to see on every subject.
      </p>
      <p>Why did we conduct a face to face rather an online class?</p>
      <p>
        The answers of the seniors are very similar to my opinion about Online
        classes. when a lesson is held during online classes some students
        tend to forget the lesson almost immediately, some have technical
        problems resulting to being unable to attend the class, and others use
        this online opportunity to go outside and do something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am really enjoying the class because of how it is being delivered,
        it is very clear that Prof. Steven took the time to create a very well
        designed lesson plan in order for everyone to learn each lesson
        precisely.
